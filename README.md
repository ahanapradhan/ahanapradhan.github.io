# Profile Summary

Ph.D. from IIT Bombay with formal models (Petri net) in focus. Equally skilled in hands-on coding from six years of extensive industry experience on building various distributed systems in data-management domain. My research interests broadly lie in the area of query processing and optimization aspects of data management systems. I am also experienced and equally interested in concurrent programming models, model driven engineering, architectural refactoring, and formulating distributed algorithms. Further, I always look forward to work out theoretically elegant solutions for
practical problems, thus, materializing fundamentals into systems research.

# TEST

<!-- STARTING POINT: A simple table that will have borders -->
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Column One</td>
      <td>Column One</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content of column one</td>
      <td>Content of columnt two</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!-- EXAMPLE 1: To remove the borders, you can add a style tag to the above example -->
<!-- Note the "!important" which ensures this style overrides other styles on the page! -->
<style>
  table td {
    border: none !important;
  }
</style>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Column One</td>
      <td>Column One</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content of column one</td>
      <td>Content of column two</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!-- EXAMPLE 2: Using a table id (BEST OPTION) -->
<!-- The above will have the disadvantage of affecting every single table on the page, to avoid that
     we can add an id to the table, this will also allow as to not use "!important" by increasing what's
     called the specificity of our style -->
<style>
  table#example-table td {
    border: none;
  }
</style>
<table id="example-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Column One</td>
      <td>Column One</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content of column one</td>
      <td>Content of column two</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!-- EXAMPLE 3 Adjusting the style of each cell separately -->
<!-- This is perhaps the simplest of the approaches - it doesn't require a separate style tag, but it does require
    adjusting the style of every cell separately -->
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: none">Column One</td>
      <td style="border: none">Column One</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: none">Content of column one</td>
      <td style="border: none">Content of column two</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
