## Profile Summary

Ph.D. from IIT Bombay with formal models (Petri net) in focus. Equally skilled in hands-on coding from six years of extensive industry experience on building various distributed systems in data-management domain. My research interests broadly lie in the area of query processing and optimization aspects of data management systems. I am also experienced and equally interested in concurrent programming models, model driven engineering, architectural refactoring, and formulating distributed algorithms. Further, I always look forward to work out theoretically elegant solutions for
practical problems, thus, materializing fundamentals into systems research.
